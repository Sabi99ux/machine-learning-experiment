# Machine Learning Experiments

This repository serves as a **learning journey log** for exploring and understanding machine learning concepts.  
All code here is the result of practice, exploration, and personal experimentation.  
It is intended to document skill development, from simple trials to more complex approaches.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Explore machine learning concepts from basic to intermediate levels.
- Test various approaches and modeling techniques.
- Document the learning process and highlight differences between versions.
- Maintain experiment records for future reference.

## ⚠️ About Code Quality
The code in this repository is **not always clean, optimized, or production-ready**.  
This is intentional because:
1. **Rapid Experimentation** – The focus is on testing ideas rather than building production-grade code.
2. **Learning Record** – The code reflects the initial learning results to track progress over time.
3. **Version Comparisons** – Different versions may use different logic or approaches.
4. **Learning from Mistakes** – Some code intentionally contains flaws to serve as evaluation material.

> **Note:** This repository is not intended for direct production use.
>
> This is my personal learning playground. Expect some chaos, bugs, and a lot of fun! 😆
